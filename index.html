            <p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called <strong>"Answer-Then-Check"</strong>, which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their "thought" and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the <strong>Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA)</strong> dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates. Notably, models fine-tuned with ReSA maintain general reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our method equips models with the ability to perform <strong>"safe completion"</strong>&mdash;unlike post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics. Furthermore, training on a small subset of just 500 examples can achieve comparable performance, suggesting that safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.</p>

          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>ReSA is based on a key insight into the nature of jailbreak attacks: malicious intent can be heavily obfuscated within a query, making it difficult for even a powerful reasoning model to detect. However, when the model attempts to generate a response, the harmful intent is often revealed and becomes much easier to identify.</p>

          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <h3>Answer-Then-Check Reasoning Template</h3>
            <p>We adopt an <strong>"Answer-Then-Check"</strong> strategy where the model first plans its answer in the Chain-of-Thought by generating a summary of the answer, then checks whether it is safe or not before generating the actual response. This approach leverages the model's reasoning capabilities to perform safety evaluation as an integral part of the generation process, rather than as a separate post-hoc step.</p>
            <p>We also introduce two variants: <strong>Adaptive ATC</strong>, which skips safety reasoning for clearly benign queries (resulting in zero overhead on benign inputs), and <strong>RL-based ATC</strong>, which uses reinforcement learning to further refine the safety reasoning process.</p>

            <h3>ReSA Dataset Construction</h3>
            <p>To implement the Answer-Then-Check approach, we construct the ReSA dataset comprising 80K examples through a systematic 3-stage pipeline:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Collecting diverse harmful and benign queries from multiple safety benchmarks</li>
              <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Generating Answer-Then-Check reasoning chains using teacher models</li>
              <li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Quality filtering and verification to ensure reasoning chain correctness</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A unique advantage of ReSA over post-hoc safety methods is its ability to perform <strong>safe completion</strong>. Post-hoc methods can only detect and reject harmful content after generation, resulting in a blunt refusal. In contrast, ReSA-trained models reason about the safety of their response <em>during</em> generation, enabling them to provide helpful, safe alternative responses.</p>
            <p>This is particularly important for sensitive topics such as self-harm, where outright refusal can be counterproductive. Instead of simply saying "I cannot answer," a ReSA-trained model can acknowledge the user's situation, provide compassionate guidance, and redirect to appropriate resources&mdash;all while refusing to provide harmful content.</p>
